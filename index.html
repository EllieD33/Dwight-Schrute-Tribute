                <h2>Who is Dwight Schrute?</h2>
                <p>Dwight Kurt Schrute III (born January 20, 1970) is a fictional character on The Office who is portrayed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0933988/" target="_blank">Rainn Wilson</a>. He is one of the highest-ranking salesmen as well as the original assistant to the regional manager, (disputed), and former Assistant Regional Manager at the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin. Additionally, he is a bed-and-breakfast proprietor at Schrute Farms, a beet plantation owner, and an owner of the business park in which Dunder Mifflin exists.</p>
                <p>Dwight is notorious for his lack of social skills and common sense, his love for martial arts and the justice system, and his office rivalry with fellow salesman Jim Halpert. He is also known for his romantic relationship with Angela Martin, head of the accounting department. He has at times risen to the position of acting Branch Manager of the Scranton branch, but primarily serves as a second or third in command as Assistant (to the) Regional Manager.</p>
